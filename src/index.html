Further Enhancements
Error Handling: What if the image paths are wrong? While not critical for a simple local setup, in a more complex application, you might want to handle cases where images fail to load.

Loading State/Placeholders: For larger images or slower connections, you might want to show a loading spinner or a placeholder image until the actual image is loaded.

Automatic Play: You could add functionality to automatically advance the carousel after a certain time interval.

Dots/Indicators: For a better user experience, you could add clickable dots below the image to directly navigate to a specific image.

Accessibility Improvements: While you have alt text, consider adding aria-live regions for screen readers if the image content changes frequently or automatically.
